# Raytracer

## Introduction
A living ray tracer project for me to build upon during my free time. Initially developed alongside [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), with intentions to explore advanced ray tracing techniques and parallelism.
## Features
- Adjustable camera
- Materials
    - Lambertian (Matte surface)
    - Metal (reflective surface)
    - Dielectric (refractive, transparent surface)
- Objects
  - Sphere
- Math Library
  - 3D Vector Support and relevant math utilities
- Floating point precision
